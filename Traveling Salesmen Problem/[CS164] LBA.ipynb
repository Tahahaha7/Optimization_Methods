    "# Optimizing Buenos Aires Tour\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description:\n",
    "In this report, we present an approach to solving the Traveling Salesmen Problem using Convex Problem Solver in Python. The aim is to minimize the distance between all the touristic attractions in the city starting from the Minerva residence hall (Hotel CH Le Petit Suites) located 933 Esmeralda street.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Touristic sites in the city:\n",
    "- Plaza de Mayo (_19 min walk from the Residence Hall_): \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the oldest public square in Buenos Aires. Around it, are famous buildings such as the seat of the national government (Casa Rosada), the Metropolitan Cathedral (Pope Francis used to conduct mass here) and Cabildo which hosts the National Museum of the Cabildo and the May Revolution.\n",
    "- San Telmo (_17 min walk from the Plaza de Mayo_):\n",
    "\n",
    "The oldest neighborhood (barrio) in Buenos Aires that features many art gallaries, art spaces and museums. It's characterized by it's colonial-style buildings and is considered by many to be the destination for contemporaty art lovers\n",
    "- Recoleta Cemetery (_58 min walk/ 16 min car ride from the San Telmo_):\n",
    "\n",
    "A cemetery, right? Located in the Recoleta neighborhood, it contains the remains of famous Argentine figures such as a grandaughter of Napolion, former presidents, first ladies nobel prize winners, among others. It contains about 5000 vaults, all above ground, with a wide variety of architectural styles such as neo-Gothic, Baroque and Art Deco. \n",
    "\n",
    "- La Boca Caminito (_91 min walk/ 25 min car ride from the Recoleta Cemetery_):\n",
    "\n",
    "A street museum of colorful painted houses. It features works by Argentine artists and it a tourism hotspot. Should you want to learn tango while sipping coffee, then you'd be pleased to know that several restauants offer tango and folk dance shows \n",
    "- Reserva Ecologica (_49 min walk/ 13 min car ride from La Boca_): \n",
    "\n",
    "Should you prefer being in nature, the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve is the biggest and most biodiverse green space in Buenos Aires. The best thing is that it's in close proximity to the downtown area so you can still enjoy it's trails either on foot or on a bike\n",
    "- Bosques Palermo (93 min walk/ 16 min car ride from Reserva Ecologica_):\n",
    "\n",
    "The oldest park on Buenos Aires that features multiple green spaces, three artificial lakes and a wide variety of biodiversity. It's a fantastic space for picnics, nature photography or exercise\n",
    "- El Ateneo Grand Splendid (_47 min walk/ 8 min car ride from Bosques Palermo_):\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most famous bookstore in Argentina. Build in 1919, it is a converted theatre where one can immerse themselves into books and coffee before making a purchase. Despite being repurposed into a bookstore, it still retains the feeling of being a theatre. \n",
    "\n",
    "- La Bombonera Stadium (_83 min walk/ 18 min car ride from El Ateneo_ ):\n",
    "\n",
    "For all soccer fans, this is the home to Boca Junior's; once of Argentina's most popular football clubs (with a fanbase of over 16 million fans)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Espacio Memoria y Derechos Humanos\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a former naval academy that was a detention center between 1976 to 1983. It's now a museum dodicated to documenting the torture and disappearance of political dissidents in this period\n",
    "\n",
    "- Palacio Borolo\n",
    "\n",
    "This was once South America's tallest building when it was completed in 1923. The 22 story building's unique design is inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Corte Comedor\n",
    "\n",
    "Did anyone say steak? What better place to enjoy Argentina's world famous beef other than in this modern steakhouse; without breaking the back, of course\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teatro Colón\n",
    "\n",
    "This imposing structure that spans an entire block is Buenos Aires' main performing arts venue. If you are into the world of theatre, ballet or opera then take this opportunity for a 50 minute long backstage tour to revel in the magnificent interior, architecture and acoustics\n",
    "\n",
    "- El Zanjon:\n",
    "\n",
    "An archeological site located in San Telmo for all those who want to immerse themselves in the city's history. It is a series of old tunnels, sewers and cisterns that date back to the 1700s and provide context into one of Buenos Aires' oldest settlements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "First, we gathered a list of popular attractions in the city and the distances relative to each other using the Google Maps API to build a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^nc_{ij}x_{ij}$$\n",
    "$$\\forall j\\in\\left[1,\\ n\\right]\\rightarrow\\sum_{j=0}^nx_{ij}=2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{ij} = c_{ji}$ : distance from city i to city j (symmetric version)\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{ij} = 1$ if the traveler visits i then j, and 0 otherwise (binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of constraints to prevents subtours: (needs revision)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall i,j\\in\\left[2,\\ n\\right]\\ \\rightarrow\\ t_i-t_j+nx_{ij}\\le n-1$$"
